Seeking two applicants to work as part-time Research Assistants on projects in development-finance with large administrative datasets and a strong policy forcus. Candidates must be able to get to Pretoria's Central Business District (where data servers are located) on a semi-regular basis (travel stipend negotiable). Appointments to begin in December through to June 2023. 

Candidates with intermediate or higher programming skills in R, Python or STATA are encouraged to apply. Passing familiarity with balance sheets, income and cashflow statements are welcome.

Applicants should send their CV and unofficial copies of their transcript(s) to my email address: [FirstInitial][LastName][at][hbs][dot][edu]. I will reach out to a subset for a 20min zoom conversation. I will send you a quick coding exercise that should take 30min but give you 2hours to return it to me. 

I imagine this role is best-suited for advanced undergraduates in related fields and perhaps masters students looking to supplement their income. Compensation is globally competitive.
